# ADB2USB
An Apple ADB to USB adapter for QMK using the ATMega32U2, featuring USB-C!
One of the projects I used as an intro to KiCad

Probably not the simplest, but follows what is said for the 32U2 datasheet.

Tested working, highly suggest a 32U2 with DFU bootloader flashed (DigiKey seems to have them preflashed)
Highly reccomend using hot air instead of an iron.
